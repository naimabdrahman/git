Once all the files are in your git workspace, you need to tell git that you want to use your current directory as a git environment.

user@host ~/git/testing $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/user/git/testing/.git/

Once your have initialized your new empty repository, you can add your files.

The following will add all files and directories to your newly created repository:

user@host ~/git/testing $ git add .

In this case, no output is good output. Unfortunately, git does not always inform you if something worked.

Every time you add or make changes to files, you need to write a commit message. The next section describes what a commit message is and how to write one.
